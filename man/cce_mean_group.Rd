cce_mean_group(
  formula,
  data,
  unit = NULL,
  time = NULL,
  na.action = na.omit,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Model formula (e.g., `y ~ x1 + x2`).}

\item{data}{A `data.frame` or `pdata.frame` containing the panel data. If `pdata.frame` is provided,
unit and time variables are inferred from `index`.}

\item{unit}{Name of the cross-sectional identifier variable (required if `data` is a `data.frame`).}

\item{time}{Name of the time variable (required if `data` is a `data.frame`).}

\item{...}{Additional options (e.g., robust standard errors).}
}
\value{
An object of class `"cce_mean_group"` containing:
\item{mean_coefs}{Mean group estimated coefficients.}
\item{std_errors}{Standard errors of the mean group estimates.}
\item{individual_coefs}{Matrix of individual unit-specific estimates.}
}
\description{
The CCE Mean Group (CCE-MG) estimator, introduced by Pesaran (2006), accounts
for cross-sectional dependence in panel data by augmenting regressions with
cross-sectional averages of dependent and independent variables.
}
\details{
Standard panel data estimators assume cross-sectional independence, which is often violated
in empirical applications due to unobserved common factors. The CCE-MG estimator
corrects for this by including cross-sectional averages as additional regressors.

The estimation follows three key steps:
1. Compute cross-sectional averages of the dependent and independent variables.
2. Estimate individual unit-level regressions with cross-sectional averages included.
3. Compute mean group estimates by averaging individual coefficients.

This estimator is robust to the presence of unobserved common factors, even if their
factor loadings vary across cross-sectional units.
