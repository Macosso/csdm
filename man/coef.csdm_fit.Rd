\title{Extract model coefficients from a fitted csdm model}
\usage{
\method{coef}{csdm_fit}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted object of class \code{csdm_fit}.}

\item{...}{Currently unused.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of estimated coefficients.
}
\description{
Returns estimated mean-group coefficients from a \code{csdm_fit} object. For
\code{model = "cs_ardl"}, the returned vector includes short-run mean-group
coefficients, the adjustment coefficient (named \code{lr_<y>}), and long-run
coefficients when available.
