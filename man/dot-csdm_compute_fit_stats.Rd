\title{Compute fit statistics for csdm models, including robust R² (mg)}
\usage{
.csdm_compute_fit_stats(
  panel_df,
  id,
  time,
  yname,
  residuals_e,
  cd_min_overlap = 2L
)
}
\description{
R² (mg) is computed for the *model-predicted values on exactly the sample present in the final residual matrix*,
ensuring robustness to index/panel alignment and NA-handling issues. This matches the definition used in xtdcce2.
See .csdm_residual_matrix_r2 for the main logic.
