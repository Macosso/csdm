\details{
\strong{Model and purpose.}
This function implements a heterogeneous dynamic panel regression with latent common factors
using the \emph{Common Correlated Effects} (CCE) approach and \emph{Mean Group} (MG) averaging.
For each cross-section \eqn{i=1,\dots,N} and time \eqn{t=1,\dots,T}, we estimate an ARDL(1) in levels:
\deqn{ y_{it} = \alpha_i + \phi_i y_{i,t-1} + x_{it}'\beta_i \;+\; z_t'\gamma_i \;+\; u_{it}, }
where \eqn{x_{it}} are unit-specific regressors and \eqn{z_t} collects \emph{cross-sectional averages} (CSAs)
of \eqn{y} and \eqn{x} and their lags (lag-augmented CCE).
The CSAs proxy the unobserved common factors and their dynamics; coefficients \eqn{(\phi_i,\beta_i,\gamma_i)}
are allowed to be heterogeneous across units. The reported MG coefficients are averages of the
unit-level estimates for the subset of "economic" parameters (intercept, \eqn{\phi_i}, and the
\eqn{\beta_i} on user-supplied regressors), excluding the CSA controls.

\strong{CCE augmentation and lagging.}
The CCE idea is to include at each \eqn{t} the contemporaneous CSAs \eqn{ \bar y_t, \bar x_t } to span the
factor space induced by pervasive shocks. With weakly exogenous regressors and dynamic factors, it is
recommended to \emph{augment} the controls with \eqn{p \ge 1} lags of those CSAs to better track factor
persistence. Practically, the function:
\enumerate{
  \item Computes time-wise means \eqn{ \bar y_t = N_t^{-1}\sum_{i\in \mathcal{I}_t} y_{it}} and
        \eqn{ \bar x_t = N_t^{-1}\sum_{i\in \mathcal{I}_t} x_{it}}, where \eqn{ \mathcal{I}_t} is the set of
        units observed at \eqn{t} (works with unbalanced panels).
  \item Forms \eqn{ \{\bar y_t, \bar x_t\}} on a \emph{time-level} table, then adds lags
        \eqn{ \{\bar y_{t-\ell}, \bar x_{t-\ell}\}_{\ell=1}^p } by time only.
  \item Merges those CSA controls back to the panel and estimates each unit equation by OLS.
}
This ordering is essential: lagging must be done \emph{by time}, not within the id-time rows, to avoid
mixing information across units.

\strong{Dynamic specification (ARDL(1)).}
The default specification includes one lag of \eqn{y_{it}} per unit (an ARDL(1) in levels). Higher-order
own lags could be added in extensions, but ARDL(1) is a common baseline in DC-CCE applications. Deterministic
components (unit intercepts) are included by default; unit-specific trends can be added in future versions.

\strong{Mean Group (MG) estimation and inference.}
Let \eqn{\hat\theta_i} be the vector of unit-level coefficients of interest (intercept, lag of \eqn{y}, and
user regressors; CSA controls are \emph{nuisance} and are not averaged). The MG estimator is
\eqn{\bar\theta = N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N \hat\theta_i}. Its variance is computed from the cross-sectional dispersion:
\deqn{ \widehat{\mathrm{Var}}(\bar\theta) = \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum_{i=1}^N
       \left(\hat\theta_i - \bar\theta\right)\left(\hat\theta_i - \bar\theta\right)'. }
Reported standard errors are the square-roots of the diagonal entries of this matrix. This is the usual MG
large-\eqn{N} inference, robust to slope heterogeneity across units. Per-unit OLS (or HC) SEs can be provided
for diagnostics, but MG uncertainty is driven by cross-section dispersion of the unit estimates.

\strong{Residual cross-sectional dependence.}
Even after CCE filtering, residuals may exhibit \emph{weak} cross-sectional dependence.
The summary method can run a dependence test; for best small-sample behavior, a bias-corrected CD test
(often called CD\*) is recommended. If only the classic CD test is available, interpret results cautiously
in factor-driven panels.

\strong{Unbalanced panels and missing data.}
CSAs at time \eqn{t} are computed using only units observed at \eqn{t}; lags of CSAs are constructed on the
time index and then merged. Per-unit regressions are estimated on the rows that are complete for that unit
(with respect to \eqn{y}, regressors, and all selected CSA controls), so some units may be dropped if
\eqn{T_i} becomes too small after lagging. MG averaging automatically adapts to the set of units actually
estimated (effective \eqn{N}).

\strong{Choosing the number of CSA lags \code{p}.}
The parameter \code{p} controls how aggressively we capture factor dynamics. Rules of thumb include small
fixed values (e.g., 1-3) for moderate \eqn{T}, or data-driven selection via information criteria in larger samples.
Excessively large \code{p} with small \eqn{T} can over-fit and reduce usable observations.

\strong{What is averaged (and what is not).}
The \code{coef} and \code{se} returned by the function pertain to the intercept, the lag of \eqn{y}, and the
user-specified regressors. The CSA controls (contemporaneous and lagged averages) are treated as high-dimensional
nuisance covariates used to span the factor space; their coefficients are \emph{not} summarized in the MG output.

\strong{Relation to alternative estimators.}
\itemize{
  \item \emph{MG vs PMG/DFE:} MG allows full slope heterogeneity and averages post-estimation.
        Pooled Mean Group (PMG) imposes long-run parameter homogeneity but allows heterogeneous adjustment
        dynamics; Dynamic Fixed Effects (DFE) imposes common slopes. MG is the least restrictive but can be less
        efficient if homogeneity holds.
  \item \emph{CCE vs standard FE:} Without CSA controls, correlated latent factors bias FE/OLS estimates when
        regressors load on the factors. CCE is designed to mitigate this by projecting on the space spanned by CSAs.
}

\strong{Numerical notes and diagnostics.}
Collinearity can arise when \code{p} is large relative to \eqn{T} or when regressors are highly persistent and
strongly correlated with CSAs. Inspect per-unit condition numbers, and consider reducing \code{p} or the set
of regressors. After estimation, inspect: (i) dispersion of unit-level coefficients, (ii) residual cross-section
tests (CD/CD\*), and (iii) sensitivity of MG estimates to \code{p}.

\strong{Limitations.}
The current version uses ARDL(1) and time-invariant \code{p} for all units. It does not (yet) include unit-specific
trends, higher-order dynamics, endogenous regressors with external instruments, or small-\eqn{T} finite-sample
corrections. These can be added in future releases.
