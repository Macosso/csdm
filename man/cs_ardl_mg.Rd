\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object like `y ~ x1 + x2 + ...`. All regressors on RHS are treated as levels
for ARDL construction; lags are generated internally.}

\item{data}{A data.frame (or tibble) with columns for `id`, `time`, `y`, `x`'s.}

\item{id, time}{Column names (strings) identifying unit and time indices.}

\item{p}{Integer \ge 1. Number of lags of y.}

\item{q}{Integer (recycled) or named integer vector for lags of each regressor
(names must match RHS variable names). `q` counts max lag; lag 0 is included by default.}

\item{P}{Integer \ge 0. Number of lags of cross-sectional averages added (lag 0..P).}

\item{loo}{Logical. If `TRUE`, compute CSAs in leave-one-out fashion.}

\item{trend}{Logical. If `TRUE`, adds a deterministic linear trend (common slope) to each unit regression.}

\item{robust_se}{One of `c("none","HC1","HC3")` for unit OLS variance; MG SEs are based on cross-sectional dispersion of unit estimates.}

\item{min_T}{Integer. Minimum time observations required per unit after lagging; units with fewer are dropped.}
}
\value{
A list with MG estimates, their SEs, CD test, and unit-level results (see Details).

A an object of class `cs_ardl_mg` with components:
- `coef_mg_short`: MG averages of the unit-level **short-run** coefficients (on the lagged \eqn{y} and lagged \eqn{x}'s).
- `coef_mg_long`: MG averages of **long-run** coefficients \eqn{\theta_k} with MG SEs.
- `phi_mg`: MG average of the sum of lagged-\eqn{y} coefficients \eqn{\sum_j \phi_{ij}} and its SE.
- `r2_mg`: average of unit-level R² from each OLS.
- `cd_stat`, `cd_pval`: Pesaran-style CD test on pooled residuals.
- `units`: tibble with unit-level results (coefficients, long-run, R², residuals index).

\description{
Estimates unit-specific ARDL(p, q) regressions augmented with cross-sectional
averages (CSAs) of the dependent variable and regressors—plus their lags up to `P`—
then averages the coefficients across units (Mean Group). The CSA terms proxy
latent common factors and mitigate cross-sectional dependence.
}
\details{
\strong{Model}. For unit \eqn{i=1,\dots,N} and time \eqn{t}, let \eqn{y_{it}} be the dependent
variable and \eqn{x_{it}} a K-vector of regressors. A CS-ARDL(p, q, P) for unit \eqn{i} is
\deqn{
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \phi_{ij} y_{i,t-j}
         + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{s=0}^{q_k} \beta_{ik,s} x_{k,i,t-s}
         + \sum_{\ell=0}^{P} \delta_{i\ell}^{(y)} \bar{y}_{t-\ell}
         + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{\ell=0}^{P} \delta_{ik,\ell}^{(x)} \bar{x}_{k,t-\ell}
         + u_{it},
}
where \eqn{\bar{y}_t} and \eqn{\bar{x}_{k,t}} are cross-sectional averages (CSAs) that can be
computed either **including** or **excluding** unit \eqn{i} (leave-one-out, `loo=TRUE`).

\strong{Long-run effects}. For each unit \eqn{i}, the long-run coefficient on regressor \eqn{k} is
\eqn{\theta_{ik} = \big(\sum_{s=0}^{q_k} \beta_{ik,s}\big) / \big(1 - \sum_{j=1}^{p} \phi_{ij}\big)},
provided the AR polynomial is stable. The function reports MG means of \eqn{\theta_{ik}} and
their MG standard errors (cross-sectional dispersion / \eqn{\sqrt{N})}.

\strong{Unbalanced panels.} Estimation drops rows with insufficient lags; CSAs at time \eqn{t}
are computed using all units with non-missing values at \eqn{t} (and excluding \eqn{i} if `loo=TRUE`).
