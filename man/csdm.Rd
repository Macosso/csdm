\arguments{
\item{formula}{A model formula like `y ~ x1 + x2`.}

\item{data}{A `data.frame` (or `plm::pdata.frame`) containing the variables in `formula`.}

\item{id, time}{Column names (strings) for the unit and time indexes.
If `data` is a `pdata.frame`, these are taken from its index and the provided values are ignored.}

\item{model}{Which estimator to fit. Currently implemented: `"mg"`, `"cce"`, `"dcce"`.}

\item{csa}{Cross-sectional-average specification, created by [csdm_csa()].}

\item{lr}{Long-run specification (currently a stub), created by [csdm_lr()].}

\item{pooled}{Pooled specification (currently a stub), created by [csdm_pooled()].}

\item{trend}{One of `"none"` or `"unit"` (a linear trend per unit is added as a regressor).
`"pooled"` is reserved and not implemented.}

\item{fullsample}{Logical; reserved for future extensions.}

\item{mgmissing}{Logical; reserved for future extensions.}

\item{vcov}{Variance-covariance specification, created by [csdm_vcov()].}

\item{...}{Reserved for future extensions.}
}
\value{
An object of class `csdm_fit`.
